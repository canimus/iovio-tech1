# IOVIO / Selenium Workflow

This repository contains a list of examples to get you started with a Test Automation journey when selecting Selenium WebDriver as your tool for steering web browsers.

The intention for this workflow is to remind us the importance of keeping up to date with new technologies that position ourselves not only as ~~Testers~~ but as __Quality Engineers__, and embrace workflows that make our day to day jobs easier.

## 0. Environment Setup
If you are starting a project most likely you will have to setup your environment, and align your activities to a workflow that makes you more productive during the day.

> Care about your own environment...<br/>
> ...and the environment will take care of you.

Ok, let's first gear up to avoid the popular phrase we all love: *"It works on my machine!"*. Now to prevent this, we need to build, not manually, but mechanically an engineered platform to develop our test assets.

### 0.1 Pre-requisites
This walkthrough requires you to have the following software installed in your laptop/workstation:

1. [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

Once you have this two boys ready, then you will be able to build everything a consistent, reliable and repeatable environment across any sort of platform.

## 1. Platform Setup

This section takes care of the setup in our local environment, in such a way that it will be managed by Vagrant and VirtualBox respectively. It describes how to construct our platform, using these two technologies:<br/> [:L01_platform_setup](http://github.com/canimus/iovio-tech1/tree/master/A_platform_setup)

## 2. Tools Setup
This section addresses using a tool that help us gain efficiencies in our workflow as well as reducing the time spent in building automated test scripts:<br/>
[:L02_tools_setup](http://github.com/canimus/iovio-tech1/tree/master/B_tools_setup)

## 3. Repository Setup
This section introduces development practices to employ version control systems around the test assets:<br/>
[:L03_repository_setup](http://github.com/canimus/iovio-tech1/tree/master/C_repository_setup)

## 4. Libraries Setup
This section introduces the library management structure, to guarantee that redeployment of solution is consistent across clients and team members:<br/>
[:L04_libraries_setup](http://github.com/canimus/iovio-tech1/tree/master/D_libraries_setup)

## 5. Development Setup
This section introduces the release mechanisms and naming conventions followed to minimise re-work and reduce maintaince activities in the code base:<br/>
[:L05_development_setup](http://github.com/canimus/iovio-tech1/tree/master/E_development_setup)

## 6. Build Setup
This section elaborates in the mechanisms to scale the automated solution, and distribute build processes to external entities outside of the development workflow:<br/>
[:L06_build_setup](http://github.com/canimus/iovio-tech1/tree/master/F_build_setup)

## 7. Framework Setup
This section introduces Patterns and Anti-Patterns in the development process, to prevent common pitfalls in automation and execution of test suites:
[:L07_framework_setup](http://github.com/canimus/iovio-tech1/tree/master/G_framework_setup)

## 8. Report Setup
This section elaborates about the different mechanisms available to present the test results, as it is perhaps the most important and relevant step in the testing process in the eyes of the business owners:<br/>
[:L08_report_setup](http://github.com/canimus/iovio-tech1/tree/master/H_report_setup)

## 9. Grid Setup
This section presents the concept associated to distributed computing and tesitng efforts, wether in a local distributed fashion or through cloud-enabled environments:<br/>
[:L09_grid_setup](http://github.com/canimus/iovio-tech1/tree/master/I_grid_setup)

## 10. Integration Setup
This section introduces the concepts associated to modern technologies, to use API's that integrate :<br/>
[:L10_integration_setup](http://github.com/canimus/iovio-tech1/tree/master/J_integration_setup)
