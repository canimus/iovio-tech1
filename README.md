# IOVIO / Selenium Induction

This repository contains a list of examples to get you started with a Test Automation journey when selecting Selenium WebDriver as your tool for steering web browsers.

The intention for this walkthrough is to remind us the importance of keeping up to date with new technologies that position ourselves not only as ~~Testers~~ but as __Quality Engineers__.

## 0. Environment Setup
If you are starting a project most likely you will have to setup your environment, and align your activities to a workflow that makes you more productive during the day.

> Care about your own environment...<br/>
> ...and the environment will take care of you.

Ok, let's first gear up to avoid the popular phrase we all love: *"It works on my machine!"*. Now to prevent this, we need to build, not manually, but mechanically an engineered platform to develop our test assets.

### 0.1 Pre-requisites
This walkthrough requires you to have the following software installed in your laptop/workstation:

1. [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

Once you have this two boys ready, then you will be able to build everything a consistent, reliable and repeatable environment across any sort of platform.

## 1. Platform Setup

Our environment locally will be managed by Vagrant and VirtualBox respectively, the next step is to construct our platform, using these two technologies.

All source code for this section is available in the folder named:<br/> __[:1_platform_setup](http://github.com/canimus/iovio-tech1/tree/master/1_platform_setup)__
